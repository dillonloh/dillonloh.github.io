      <h1>Hi, I'm Dillon Loh</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer at Hiverlab, where I focus on building scalable ML/CV-based solutions and robotic simulations.
        I did my BSc at Nagoya University and majored in Physics, focusing on theoretical astrophysics research.
        I will be joining the University of Cambridge’s MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence programme in Sep 2025!

      <p> My CV can be found <a href="/static/(2025) Academic CV - Dillon.pdf">here</a>.

        More importantly, I squat 140kg, bench 110kg, and OHP 80kg @ 74kg bw (no i don’t deadlift)
